# 100 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python Challenge! üöÄ

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the 100 days of Python challenge, where I commit to coding and learning Python every day for 100 days.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Python Challenge is a commitment to improving your Python programming skills by coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days straight. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Python or an experienced developer aiming to reinforce your skills, this challenge is for you!

## Goals

- **Improve Python Proficiency:** Strengthen my understanding of Python syntax, concepts, and best practices.
- **Build Projects:** Apply my Python skills to create useful and interesting projects.
- **Expand Knowledge:** Explore advanced Python topics such as data science, web development, automation, and more.

## Rules

1. Code for a minimum of Two hour every day.
2. Share my progress on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfPython.
3. Document my daily progress in this repository by committing code, notes, and reflections.

## Structure

- **Daily Progress:** Each day, I will create a new directory labeled with the respective day number (e.g., Day1, Day2, etc.).
- **Code:** Within each daily directory, I will include the Python code I wrote or learned.
- **Notes:** I will also document any insights, challenges, or new concepts I encountered during the day's coding session.
- **Resources:** Links to helpful tutorials, articles, and documentation will be included for further learning.

## Motivation

By participating in the 100 Days of Python Challenge, I aim to solidify my Python skills, cultivate discipline, and build a habit of consistent learning. Through daily practice and reflection, I believe I can achieve my goal of becoming a proficient Python developer.
