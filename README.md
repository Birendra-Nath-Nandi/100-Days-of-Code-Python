# 100 Days of Python Challenge

Welcome to the 100 Days of Python Challenge! üöÄ

This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey through the 100 days of Python challenge, where I commit to coding and learning Python every day for 100 days.

## About the Challenge

The 100 Days of Python Challenge is a commitment to improving your Python programming skills by coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days straight. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn Python or an experienced developer aiming to reinforce your skills, this challenge is for you!

## Goals

- **Improve Python Proficiency:** Strengthen my understanding of Python syntax, concepts, and best practices.
- **Build Projects:** Apply my Python skills to create useful and interesting projects.
- **Expand Knowledge:** Explore advanced Python topics such as data science, web development, automation, and more.

## Rules

1. Code for a minimum of Two hour every day.
2. Share my progress on social media using the hashtag #100DaysOfPython.
3. Document my daily progress in this repository by committing code, notes, and reflections.

## Structure

- **Daily Progress:** Each day, I will create a new directory labeled with the respective day number (e.g., Day1, Day2, etc.).
- **Code:** Within each daily directory, I will include the Python code I wrote or learned.
- **Notes:** I will also document any insights, challenges, or new concepts I encountered during the day's coding session.
- **Resources:** Links to helpful tutorials, articles, and documentation will be included for further learning.

## Motivation

By participating in the 100 Days of Python Challenge, I aim to solidify my Python skills, cultivate discipline, and build a habit of consistent learning. Through daily practice and reflection, I believe I can achieve my goal of becoming a proficient Python developer.

## Progress Log

- [x] **Day 1:** Learned about the `input()` and `print()` functions, mastered variable manipulation, and debugged my first program.

- [x] **Day 2:** Explored data types, type checking and typecasting, mathematical operations and priority rules, round functions, f-strings, and shorthand operations. Completed the Tip Calculator challenge program.

- [x] **Day 3:** Studied control flow using `if`/`else` and conditional operators, including nested `if`/`elif`/`else` statements and logical operators. Completed the Treasure Island Game challenge program.

- [x] **Day 4:** Examined the `random` module and lists, along with list methods. Completed the Rock, Paper, Scissors challenge program.

- [x] **Day 5:** Learned about `for` loops and developed four programs: Average Height, High Score Finder, Adding Even Numbers, and the FizzBuzz game. Completed the Random Password Generator challenge program.

- [x] **Day 6:** Studied `while` loops and indentations, and created a program for a virtual robot to navigate a maze in 'Reeborg's World'.

- [x] **Day 7:** Developed a complete Hangman game from scratch.

- [x] **Day 8:** Learned about functions with arguments, and created two practice programs: Paint Area Calculator and Prime Number Checker. Completed the Caesar Cipher challenge program.

- [x] **Day 9:** Explored dictionaries and nested data structures (lists and dictionaries). Created two practice programs: Grading System and Dictionary in List. Completed the Blind Auction challenge program.

- [x] **Day 10:** Studied functions with multiple return values, and created a practice program to calculate days in a month. Completed the Calculator challenge program.

- [x] **Day 11:** Developed a complete Blackjack Game project from scratch.

- [x] **Day 12:** Learned about local and global scopes, and constants. Created a Number Guessing Game.

- [x] **Day 13:** Studied debugging techniques: describing the problem, reproducing the bug, simulating the computer, fixing errors, using print statements, and utilizing a debugger.

- [x] **Day 14:** Created a Higher or Lower game program from scratch.

- [x] **Day 15:** Built a Coffee Machine program from scratch in Python. This project involved handling resources, processing transactions, and making decisions based on user input.

- [x] **Day 16:** Delved into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), explored turtle graphics, and learned about Python packages. Created an OOP Coffee Machine program to apply the new concepts.

- [x] **Day 17:** Deepened understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by studying classes, methods, and created an OOP Quiz Game Program.

- [x] **Day 18:** Explored the Turtle module and completed the Hirst Painting Project. This project was an exciting opportunity to unleash creativity and create stunning artwork using Python.

- [x] **Day 19:** Delved deeper into Turtle methods and created the Turtle Race program. This project was an exciting challenge to simulate a thrilling race among colorful turtles using Python.

- [x] **Day 20:** Began creating a Snake Game (Part 1 of 2). It's exciting to dive into game development and explore the world of Python programming.

- [x] **Day 21:** Continued working on the Snake Game (Part 2 of 2). It's amazing to see the game taking shape with enhanced functionality and features.

- [x] **Day 22:** Built a classic Pong game from scratch. It was an incredible experience implementing the logic for paddles, ball movement, and scoring system.

- [x] **Day 23:** Created an addictive Turtle Crossing game. It's a thrilling challenge where the player navigates through traffic to reach the other side safely.

- [x] **Day 24:** Dove into file handling in Python. Learned how to open, read, and write to files using the `with` keyword, and explored absolute and relative file paths.
